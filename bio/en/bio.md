Tommaso “Tommi” Marmo is an independent researcher, activist, artist, and community weaver who focuses on political technology, digital rights awareness, and data degrowth.

Tommi’s mission is to create bridges and connections, intertwining stories and experiences through inter-disciplinary activities that explore the most diverse topics. His work spans several fronts, and he committed to different fights over time.

As a teenager, he was a speaker and chief editor at [<cite lang=it>Radioimmaginaria</cite>](https://radioimmaginaria.it/en). In 2019, he co-founded a local chapter of [LIBERA](https://www.libera.it/it-schede-1326-libera_inglese), an Italian network of organizations fighting mafia through cultural and educational endeavours. In 2020, he invented and founded <cite lang=it>[Scambi](https://scambi.org/en/)</cite>, the Festival of Paneurethic workshops, of which he is now the president. In 2023 he graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> in [Philosophy, International Studies, and Economics](https://unive.it/pise/) with a thesis titled <cite>[Computer Sciences Are Social Sciences](https://tommi.space/csss/). The workshop series <cite>[Knitting Our Internet](https://ournet.rocks/)</cite> was born out of the research for his thesis, his main project to date.

Being a relentless enthusiastic and curious person, Tommi also worked with many and various organizations, including the [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org), and [Giffoni Film Festival](https://giffonifilmfestival.it). He was a scout chief, and he is a member of the [Association of Internet Researchers](https://aoir.org), the [Coalition for Independent Technology Research](https://independenttechresearch.org), [Banca Etica](https://bancaetica.it), and [Club Tenco](https://clubtenco.it). He is the creator and administrator of <cite>[Pan](https://pan.rent/about)</cite>, a [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) instance.

If there is any time left, or in case he can find some, Tommi contributes to Free Software projects, he plays table-top role-playing games (TTRPGs), he cycles and he couchsurfs around the planet.
